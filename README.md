Jaaaaaaaaaaaavascript!
======================
Now that our ubermelon app _works_, we're going to add just a little bit of polish by improving some interactions with javascript and jQuery. We're going to add three dynamic interactions to the ubermelon site:

1. An annoying promotion popup screen
2. A shopping cart summary popup that updates with information from the server. 

Getting Set Up
--------------
The procedure is the same as before, mostly. Clone, virtualenv, etc. However, you will have to switch branches from the master branch to the ajax branch after cloning.

Navigate to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) and get started.

Task 1: Summer Melon Sale
-------------------------

Generally, the procedure is to create the HTML as a static part of the page then use javascript to hide and display it.

###Subtask 1: Create the HTML

Create a div called blackout-screen
Create a div called promotion
Create an H1 and an A tag

###Subtask 2: Wire up the clicky clicky

Create a function to do the interaction
Make the interaction respond to a click
